- I am an Associate Professor of Epidemiology **@YaleSPH**. I am also a member of the Yale **Public Health Modeling Unit**. 

- I lead a research group that focuses on the epidemiology of respiratory infections, including pneumococcus, RSV, Legionella, and SARS-CoV-2. We use a variety of methods including statistical modeling and data analytics; experimental microbiology; and field sampling. 

- I specialize in the analysis of **real-world data** for understanding disease dynamics and the effects of interventions, including the development of novel time series and spatial methods. 

- I teach a class at Yale "Introduction to the Analysis and Interpretation of Public Health Surveillance Data" and regularly teach workshops on statistical analysis for practitioners.
